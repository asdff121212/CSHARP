--> It is hard for Complex Applications.


Concepts of OOPs(6 pillars of OOPs)
--> CLass and Objects
--> Methods
--> Ihheritance 
--> Polymorphism
--> Abstraction
--> Encapsulation

--> CLass and Objects:- 
        CLass                                                           ||                   Object
--> Class is Blueprint/Template.                                           --> Object is INstance of Class.
--> Class is Not A Real World Entity. like animals, class means lambo is   --> Object is A Real World Entity. like dog, cat which we can see in the real world.
real world entity.              
--> Class do not occupy Memory.                                            --> Object Occupy Memory.


--> CLass has Attributes and Behaviour. Based on Class, Object has Same Atttributes and Behaviour.
For exmpale:- Car class have Attributes: Model, Color, Price and Behaviours like Run(), Accelerate().
