--> LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.
--> using System.Linq; namespace is used for LINQ
--> LINQ in C# is used to work with data access from data sources such as objects, data sets, SQL Server,and XMl etc.
                    
--> C# Application<---------------LINQ-->execute query        DATA SOURCE
                       objects          <-- Get Results

--> LINQ is a data quering API with SQL like query syntaxes.
--> Syntax 
1) int [] age = {12,23,4,45,23,32,1,212,12,34,3,45,67,99};
        var data = from i in age where i > 10  select i;
        foreach(int item in data)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
2) for ascending and descending order (by default ascending)
int [] age = {12,23,4,45,23,32,1,212,12,34,3,45,67,99};
        var data = from i in age where i > 10 orderby descending i select i;
        foreach(int item in data)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
        }
3) for finding string name conatinaing letter a 
 string [] names = {"pawan","randy","ortan","underataker"};

        var data = from i in names where i.Contains("a")  select i;
        foreach(string item in data)
        {
        Console.WriteLine(item);
        }





--> LINQ TO SQL in C        #
--> If we want to work with LINQ TO SQL, first we have to convert or map all the relational objects of database into object oriented types.
--> This process is called ORM(Object Relational Mapping)
--> To perform ORM we have to use a tool called OR Designer.

Relational Types  ||  Object Oriented Types
--> Table         --> Class
--> Column        --> Property
-->Row            --> Object/INstance
-->Stored Procedure --> Method


-->3 steps to implement LINQ TO SQL 
1) perform ORM by adding OR Designer
2) add refrence i.e System.Data.Linq
3) write connection string into the config file



Working of LINQ
Application --> LINQ Queries --> LINQ Providers --> Data sources
here we write Linq queries in C# and LINQ providers provides interface for different database like for SQL it provide SQl queries , in mYSQL it provide MYSQL queries.


LINQ Providers
1.LINQ-To-Objects
-->It provides us the ability to write and execute query against in-memory objects e.g. arrays, collections and gererics.
2.LINQ-To-SQL 
--> This is designed to work only with MS SQL Server. This is much like an ORM that allows one-to-one / one-to-many mapping between SQL objects and .NET classes
3.LINQ -TO-Datasets 
-->It allows users to query cached data in a dataset.
4.LINQ-To-Entities
-->It looks like LINQ-TO-SQL. It means , it is also an ORM.It allows one-to-one, one-to-many mapping between database objects and .NET classes.
--> It work with other database as well like Oracle, Mysql, DB2 etc
5. LINQ-TO-XML
-->It is designed to work with XML documents. It allows user to perform differnet operations on XMMM data 
--> System.Xml.Linq is the namespace we need to use LINQ-TO-XMl


-->There are three main stages of LINQ Query Execution
1)Initialization--> form data in datasource
2)Condition --> wheer data_filter_condition
3) Selection --> select data

#LAMDA Expression
--> Lambda expression is a function without name. It keeps syntax clear and short. It consists of two parts:- 1)Input 2)Expression

#IEnumerable 
1) IEnumerbale is an interface. It is availabe in System.Collection namespace.
2) A collection of IEnumerable type can be iterated. like loop , for loop, foreach, while etc
3) This interface has a method called GetEnumerator
4) GetEnumerator return an IEnumerator which iterates through collection.
